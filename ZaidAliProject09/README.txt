“I, Zaid Ali, with BlazerID zaidali completed this project on my own, with no external help or information except the official Javadocs, official class textbook, class lectures, instructor or TAs. I understand that any use of non-sanctioned materials (e.g., stack overflow, etc.)  is considered cheating and will result in a zero for this project, as well as reporting to the department, college, and university for further actions.”


Extra Features

>The colors of the gym when the Objection fight change randomly. It is a little loud and unnecessary, but why not?

>Turn up the volume! I have managed to incorporate music and some sound effects in the Objectmon battle process.
